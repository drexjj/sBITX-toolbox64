This version of remote.c includes some changes and improvements over the sbitx version. Here are the main differences:

Buffer Null-Termination in remote_slice:
I've implemented a fix that ensures the buffer receiving data from the client is null-terminated (using buffer[len] = '\0';) before any processing haooens. This adjustment was necessary for preventing buffer overflow or string processing errors, allowing string manipulation functions to operate safely when received data over the telnet socket.

Handling Client Disconnects:
The original method handled disconnects using "recv() returns '0'" to perform shutdown by the telnet client, My version checks for "len == 0" and responds by closing the TCP socket. It also displays a message in command line to inform of a disconnect from the client. This makes the system more reliable by gracefully handling client disconnects.

Error Handling for Socket Read:
I changed the part of the code where "recv()" is handled. My code explicitly handles the case where recv() returns a value less than 0 but is not due to the lack of data to read. This ensures that unexpected errors lead to closing the socket.

Command Processing:
The original command process (triggered by if (buffer[0] == '?') {...} and else if(strlen(buffer)) {...}) mostly remains the same. I've made sure that buffer null-termination precedes these checks. This step is essential for reliable command interpretation.

Additional Messaging:
My version introduces more detailed messages that inform on client disconnection and connection errors to aid troubleshooting.

The basic operations between the original version and my version are similar, my changes enhance sbitx's dependability with buffer handling and management of client disconnections and errors. - JJ W9JES
